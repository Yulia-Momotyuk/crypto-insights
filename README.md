# CryptoInvest Insight â€” Investment Strategies & Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the cryptocurrency market (BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, XRP) using **historical data extracted directly via CoinGecko API**. 
The dataset was engineered into daily time series with returns, volatility, and drawdowns, forming the basis for an end-to-end analytical pipeline.  

The goal was to evaluate investment strategies, riskâ€“return tradeoffs, and test whether even basic ML models can forecast short-term market dynamics.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Engineering**: Python (requests, pandas, numpy), CoinGecko API (automated data extraction).  
- **Data Analysis**: matplotlib, seaborn (EDA & visualization), scipy (t-tests), sklearn (Linear Regression).  
- **BI & Visualization**: Power BI with **custom DAX measures** (ROI %, Volatility, Sharpe, Sortino, Max Drawdown).  
- **Workflow**: Jupyter Lab for integration of analysis, modeling, and storytelling.

## Methodology
1. - **Source**: CoinGecko API (historical data 2024â€“2025).  
   - **Main dataset**: `crypto_market.csv`  
   - `date` â€” trading day  
   - `symbol` â€” coin (BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, XRP)  
   - `price_usd`, `volume_usd`, `market_cap_usd`  
   - Calculated metrics: `return_pct`, `drawdown_pct`, `rolling_vol_14d`, `roi_pct`, `is_dip_3d`  
   - **Additional dataset**: `sim_results.csv` with strategy simulation results.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Trends, seasonality (weekday/month), volatility & drawdown analysis.  
   - Correlation heatmap between assets.  

3. **Investment Strategy Simulations**  
   - Modeled **Buy & Hold, Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), Buy-on-Dip**.  
   - Compared ROI (%) and final values ($).  
   - Riskâ€“Return Map to visualize performance.  

4. **Statistical Testing**  
   - **t-tests**: examined whether high-volume days significantly impact returns.  
   - Results: strong effect for BTC & XRP; not significant for ETH, SOL, ADA.  

5. **Machine Learning Forecast**  
   - Applied **Linear Regression** with TimeSeriesSplit for BTC (7-day horizon).  
   - RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.77 â†’ model captures general trend but underperforms on sharp spikes.  

6. **BI Dashboard**  
   - Power BI dashboard with KPI cards, Riskâ€“Return Map, Sharpe ratio comparison, drawdown analysis.  
   - Interactive **strategy simulator** (Buy & Hold, DCA, Buy-on-Dip).

## Key Insights
- **XRP & ADA**: highest ROI, but also highest drawdowns (high-risk/high-reward).  
- **BTC & ETH**: portfolio stabilizers with moderate, reliable returns.  
- **SOL**: weakest performer in the sample.  
- **Strategies**: Buy & Hold was the most consistent; DCA lowered risks but reduced returns; Buy-on-Dip only worked in selective cases.  
- **Volume Analysis**: BTC & XRP are highly sensitive to trading volumes.  
- **ML Model**: captured BTCâ€™s overall trend, but failed during extreme volatility.

### Business & Technical Goals  
- **Business Impact**: clear framework to evaluate crypto assets and strategies by profitability vs risk.  
- **Technical Impact**: demonstrates **full-stack analytics** â€” API â†’ Python â†’ statistics â†’ ML â†’ Power BI storytelling.
